  "This game has text centered in the middle of the screen"
  "It has a background behind it, and you can change the image like any other narrat screen if you want"
  "The goal of this template is to have a game focused on the text where the background images aren't as important (or could even be removed)"
  "Look at the css file to customise how this game looks"
  "The dialog will now end and the dialogue panel will close. Up to you to write the rest of your game."
